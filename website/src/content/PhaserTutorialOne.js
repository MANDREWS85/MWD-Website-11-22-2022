      <p>Today we will be learning Phaser. This first tutorial will allow us to instance a canvas object in our HTML. Along with a text object and a Sprite. Lets create a repl at repl.it . Luckily Repl.it has a Phaser JS template all ready to go for us.

You will notice 3 files and a folder created. The index.html file is our loading page for our Phaser app. The style.css file styles our HTML page and Phaser Canvas. Next our script.js file will hold our Phaser game logic.
